# Puzzles and Prompts
Here is a collection of assignments, challenges and puzzles that you can do with Python. Let's keep building out this list with new ideas and links and projects.

# Creative Prompts/Assignments
### Choose Your Own Adventure
Write a story that someone can navigate through like a game, along the lines of a [choose your own adventure story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure). 
You can use text that you write yourself, text that you find, or some combination of both.

[Here's a quick link](https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/basics/getting-user-input-from-the-keyboard) for how to take user input in python. 

### Algorithmic Poetry
Transform a non-poetic text into a poetic text. Take something that exists, do something that transforms it.

- start with any text that's interesting to you: something you're reading in another class, a work of literature, a political speech, music, poetry, twitter, restaurant menu, etc. 

- up to you to determine what’s poetic

- explore word counts if you're interested

- [example/starting point](https://github.com/aparrish/rwet/blob/master/some-poetry-generators.ipynb)


Read some file, or if the text is short you can just put that text directly into python as a variable.

If you don’t know what to do try sorting, randomizing, replacing, deleting things. By taking something that exists and using these methods we can reformat it and rework it. You can use whatever is at your disposal. You’re not bound by command line or python, so you can take the output of that text and you’re welcome to format it into something interesting, put it into p5, whatever you want to do.

* If you’re more advanced, you can start to get into using third party libraries to analyze text. Look at [TextBlob](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/) and [spaCy](https://github.com/aparrish/rwet/blob/master/nlp-concepts-with-spacy.ipynb). 

* If you’re feeling ambitious, make this program so that it can deal with any text. Make this poetic operation so it can work with any text that you feed it.

# Mathy Prompts/Assignments
### Fibonnaci Challenge
Ever heard of the fibonacci sequence? It goes (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21...) and you predict the next number by adding the previous two. So for the part of the sequence I gave the next would be 13+21 which is 33. Try to write a function that will tell you the Nth number in the fibonacci sequence. 

What happens when you give 34 as the input? what abe 67?

Try to write a faster version of the function. (hint: dictionaries are your friend!)
