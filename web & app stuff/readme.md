#### *JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
#### 1. .json files are a nice way to store data for later just make sure you have an effective way to store it and retrieve it
#### 2. .json files are often used as a way to communicate information across languages e.g. python ==> javascript (which can render html)

### * Servers are important for testing and developing apps
#### 1. if you running a local server it will likely be at `localhost:[some port number]` when you start your server you will know the port, either because you set it or whatever tool you are using will tell you
#### 2. `localhost:3000` is the exact same thing as `127.0.0.1:3000` these are both loopback adresses for computer and so they are self referencial. You will need a file labeled index.html with html content to display
